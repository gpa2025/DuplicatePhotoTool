# GPA Duplicate Photo Tool

**Version:** 1.0.1  
**Author:** Built by Gianpaolo, with engineering assistance from Amazon Q.  
**License:** MIT — see [LICENSE](LICENSE)

A fast, multi-threaded PowerShell-based duplicate photo detection and cleanup tool for Windows.

---

## 🚀 Features

### 🔍 Parallel SHA256 Hashing
Uses PowerShell 7 `ForEach-Object -Parallel` with batched processing across up to 16 CPU cores for maximum throughput on large photo libraries.

### ⚡ LiteDB Index Database
Stores file metadata + hash in `src\checksum_cache.db` (LiteDB) alongside the script. Unchanged files are skipped on re-scans — no re-hashing needed. Includes a `scan_history` collection tracking every scan run. Open with [LiteDB Studio](https://github.com/mbdavid/LiteDB.Studio/releases) to browse and query.

### 🛡 Safe Duplicate Detection
Only exact SHA256 duplicates are moved. The original file is always kept in place. Every move is logged with the original file location.

### 📁 Folder Structure Preservation
Duplicates are moved into a mirrored directory tree under your chosen output folder.

### 📊 CSV Report + Scan Log
Every duplicate move is recorded in `duplicate_report.csv` with original path, duplicate path, destination, and hash. A timestamped `scan_log_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-mm-ss.txt` is written to the output folder and viewable directly from the GUI.

### ⏱ Scan Timer
Elapsed time is logged at the end of every scan with a summary of duplicate groups found and files processed.

### 🎨 GUI Launcher
A dark-themed WPF interface with:
- Splash screen with branding
- Context-sensitive help in the status bar
- Live MM:SS timer display
- Dry Run checkbox
- CPU cores slider (1–16)
- View Log button — opens `scan_log.txt` in a built-in log viewer

### ⏰ Scheduled Task Wrapper
Automate duplicate scans on any schedule via Windows Task Scheduler.

### 🔧 Setup & Uninstall Scripts
One-command install and uninstall — creates Start Menu and Desktop shortcuts, registers the scheduled task, and sets up AppData directories.
